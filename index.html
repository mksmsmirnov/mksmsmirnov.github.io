                    I am currently a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cerge-ei.cz/">CERGE-EI</a>. I specialize in econometrics, with a focus on instrumental variables estimation, dimension asymptotics, and causal inference.

                <p class="explanation">We provide insights on asymptotic behavior of the off-diagonal elements of projection matrices in settings, where the dimension of underlying vectors grows with the sample size. Under designs favorable to application of the random matrix theory, the off-diagonal elements are asymptotically normal with a simple variance expression. We also discuss the robustness of the result to deviations of the design from the ideal setup.</p>

                <p class="explanation">
                    We characterize the joint asymptotic behavior of diagonal and off-diagonal elements of projection matrices, say $P = Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'$, whose underlying dimension $\ell$ is asymptotically proportional to sample size $n$, that is, $\ell/n \xrightarrow[]{} \alpha$ as $n \xrightarrow[]{} \infty$, with the aspect ratio $\alpha \in (0,1)$, under the rotated i.i.d. assumption for elements of $Z$. The rate of
                    convergence is $\sqrt{n}$, and the limiting distribution is multivariate centered Gaussian. The formulas for the asymptotic variances and covariances are expressed as functions
                    of $\alpha$ and moments of elements of $Z$. The instrumental tools in deriving the asymptotic
                    results are the Woodbury matrix identity, CLT for quadratic and bilinear forms, and
                    elements of the random matrix theory such as the Marchenko-Pastur law.

                <p><strong>Many instruments estimation and inference under clustered dependence</strong> <i>(with Stanislav Anatolyev)</i>
                    [<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/md413gu31b6sbeipzdiih/cjiv_slides.pdf?rlkey=auj5q4nwdylzdcsiplu6y1x58&st=q7ovjo1s&dl=0">slides</a>]
                </p>
                <p class="explanation">We study many weak instruments in a heteroskedastic environment under
                    clustering. We
                    show that clustering either deems the jackknife instrumental variables estimation inconsistent, or makes its inferences hugely distorted. We suggest, instead of following
                    the "save the Jackknife" approach, an alternative approach, which is computationally
                    attractive and allows general structures of intra-cluster correlations. We use the natural extension of jackknifing, the leave-cluster-out methodology, applied to the instrument projection matrix, which allows one to dispose of the cross-cluster dependencies
                    in the influence function of the structural parameter estimator. We set out a formal
                    asymptotic framework to analyze the proposed cluster-jackknife instrumental variables
                    (CJIV) estimator, with an increasing number of clusters, possibly increasing heterogeneous cluster sizes, and possible presence of many weak instruments. We prove a
                    central limit theorem for the influence function embedded in the CJIV estimator, and
                    show consistency of the associated CJIV variance estimator. We study the importance
                    of instrument design on the properties of CJIV, run a simulation study revealing its
                    finite sample properties, and compare with other estimators in relevant empirical contexts.</p>

I show that workhorse two-stage least-squares estimator and jackknife instrumental variables estimators are biased in finite samples and propose an alternative unbiased estimator that builds on non-linearity of the first stage, randomized assignment mechanism and latency of judge strictness.</p> -->
